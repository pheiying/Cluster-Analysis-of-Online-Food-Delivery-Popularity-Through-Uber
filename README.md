## Introduction
This project utilises Spectral Clustering, Fuzzy C-means, and Hierarchical Clustering to uncover customer segments and insights within Uber Eats USA data, driving strategic recommendations.

## Usage
To run the clustering analysis, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, you can install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory where the Jupyter Notebook is located:
    ```bash
    cd ClusterAnalysisOfUberEats
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `ClusterAnalysisOfUberEats.ipynb` file.

5. Download the dataset from [Uber Eats USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/uber-eats-usa-restaurants-menus?select=restaurants.csv) and rename it as `restaurants.csv`. Place the file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

6. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the clustering analysis.
